# hello-world
This is a repository created to familiarize myself with the basics of GitHub.

My name is James Wadsworth, a student in the 2019 MS GIST program. I work for the University of Arizona as a GIS Data Analyst in the Department of Planning, Design & Construction. Before this, I got my BS and MS in Environmental Sciences here at the University as well. I am excited to learn about open source GIS because I have had no previous experience working in the open source GIS environment and think that it would be a valuable skill to learn alongside my ESRI-based GIS knowledge.
